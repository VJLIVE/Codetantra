In DBMS, a JOIN is an operation used to combine data from two or more tables based on a column which is related to both tables.
It is used to retrieve data that is spread across multiple tables and combines them into one single result.

There are many primarily 4 types of JOINS:
Starting with INNER JOIN: It combines rows from both tables where there is a match in the related columns

Next, LEFT JOIN: It returns all rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table, if no match, it will return null values in those cells.

RIGHT JOIN: It is similar to LEFT JOIN, but it returns all rows of the right table and matching rows from the left table.

And the last CROSS JOIN: It returns the cartesian product of both tables by giving all the possible combinations of rows from both tables.
